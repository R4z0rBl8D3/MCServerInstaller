# MCServerInstaller
This app can create a server locally.
This app is missing some versions of Minecraft, like 1.17.1 because the installer didn't work or the server ended up being weird.
# How to use it
This is what you will see when you open the app.

Over here you can select which software you want for your server.
And then select the version and click install.

A window will appear asking for the name of the server. It will download the server and start it up to create the folders and files, when the console says done then you can close it.
